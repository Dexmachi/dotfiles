error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:Dexmachi/Dextall.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not

hint: the same ref. If you want to integrate the remote changes, use
hint: 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

(The error was parsed as 11: The repository has been updated since you last pulled. Try pulling before pushing.)
